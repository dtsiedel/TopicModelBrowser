(BARS)
-topic name on bars 
-tooltip
-show related topics with lines

(DONUT)

(CORPUS)
-repeated code with donut
-add the ribbons 
-figure out legend (maybe just have it scrollable?)

(GENERAL)
-split getData() so that we can consolidate repeated bits to library.js - easiest way would be to make it take a parameter for the function that it calls at the end
-from each document pull up "related" and have a view/compare option for each to get to comparison view
|->or have multiple select on corpus screen, we haven't decided
-make getTopicIndices() only called once (do this after we've merged views). Cache results of fetching csv data when appropriate
-lot of general cleanup for repeated code, bad naming, etc.
