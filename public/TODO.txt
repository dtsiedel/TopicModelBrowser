(GENERAL)
-data pipeline
-introduce other metadata (i.e. aggregate by blog, or anything else given)
-alternate naming (termite)
-help button/page
-topic numbering starting from 1?
-user setting names of topics
-Search vs. Browse
-cross-browser support (Firefox wtf)
-prevent all pages from scrolling? (besides single topic)

(BARS)

(DONUT)
-move excerpt from on hover to bottom right (and annotate all words in it)
-improved excerpt system (precompute excerpts for each doc-topic pair, and for document in general. Then put all into spectrum)

(CORPUS)
-opacity higher on hidden ribbons
-include top n words on topic selector on right
-topic n should be more clearly a title on flag (size?)
-add options for all/none/cardinal instead of single toggle - maybe radio boxes
-For right pane:
    -need to differentiate the two panes in some way
    -need to remove clutter (fold up top one when bottom is open?)
    -bottom pane buttons should follow scroll?
-simple/advanced and selected topics should be fragment parameters, and the particular ribbon selected for the bottom pane
-make ribbon select stay until you mark another one

(SPECTRUM)

(TOPIC)

(NODES)
-fix tooltip disappearing on reload
-make click mark them (show info w/ link) instead of immediately linking
-add legend

(LONGTERM)
