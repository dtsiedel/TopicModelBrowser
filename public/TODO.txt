(BARS)

(DONUT)
-move excerpt from on hover to bottom right (and annotate all words in it)

(CORPUS)
-devise new way to do the sizes, etc
-ribbon select stays until you mark another one
-representation of topics that aren't linked to anything
-persistent word labels on topics? With just a few

(SPECTRUM)
-consider transparency of some sort to indicate selected documents in spectrum
-or have fewer docs in it for legibility

(TOPIC)
-return to view goes to page you were on

(NODES)
-make nodes small pie charts of the document
-make click mark them (show info w/ link) instead of immediately linking

(LONGTERM)
-fragments for page control
-figure out improved way to represent nodes (scaling?)
-use browser back button
-https ('tell node we want to use ssh?')
