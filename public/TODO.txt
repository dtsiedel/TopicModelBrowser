(BARS)
-topic name on bars 
-tooltip
-show related topics with lines

(DONUT)

(CORPUS)
-figure out different scaling for widths of ribbons 
-figure out legend (maybe just have it scrollable?)
-make the self links be the documents that are only about that topic (calculate in preprocess)

(GENERAL)
-change name from Binary Topic to Correlated Topics (etc.)
-split getData() so that we can consolidate repeated bits to library.js - easiest way would be to make it take a parameter for the function that it calls at the end
-make getTopicIndices() only called once (do this after we've merged views). Cache results of fetching csv data when appropriate

(SINGLE TOPIC)
-Alex is doing it

(MULTI TOPIC)
-Lena is doing it
