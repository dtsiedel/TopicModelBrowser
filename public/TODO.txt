(BARS)

(DONUT)
-move excerpt from on hover to bottom right (and annotate all words in it)
-improved excerpt system (precompute excerpts for each doc-topic pair, and for document in general. Then put all into spectrum)

(CORPUS)
-For right pane:
    -need to differentiate the two panes with some kind of styling
    -each pane's buttons should follow scroll?
-simple/advanced and selected topics should be fragment parameters, and the particular ribbon selected for the bottom pane
-make ribbon select stay until you mark another one

(SPECTRUM)
