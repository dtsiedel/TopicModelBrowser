(BARS)
-topic name on bars 
-tooltip
-show related topics with lines

(DONUT)

(CORPUS)
-make ribbons color gradient (reversed colors)
-figure out legend (maybe just have it scrollable?)
-make the self links be the documents that are only about that topic (calculate in preprocess)
-repeated code with donut

(GENERAL)
-modify the R topic model to get out the metadata we need (urls) so that we can get our document's text/metadata/link
-split getData() so that we can consolidate repeated bits to library.js - easiest way would be to make it take a parameter for the function that it calls at the end
-make getTopicIndices() only called once (do this after we've merged views). Cache results of fetching csv data when appropriate
-change name from Binary Topic to Correlated Topics (etc.)
